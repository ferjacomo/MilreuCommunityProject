**Engaging Communities with Their Historical Heritage: Public and Community Archaeology at the Roman Ruins of Milreu (Estoi, Faro)**

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the Milreu Community Project — a long-term public and community archaeology initiative based in Estoi (Faro, Portugal), focused on fostering meaningful engagement between local communities and their historical heritage.
